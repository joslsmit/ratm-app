# RATM Draft Kit: Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of the RATM Draft Kit project against the defined deployment and integration plan.

## Overall Deployment Goal
Make the RATM Draft Kit app live for friends, affordably and reliably, ensuring it's always online to handle Yahoo API connections and preparing for future development.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Deploying the Flask Backend to Render
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**
*   **Description:** The Python Flask backend has been successfully prepared for production and deployed to Render.
*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   `requirements.txt` generated with all Python dependencies (including `gunicorn`).
    *   Backend deployed to Render with appropriate build and start commands.
    *   `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` configured as an environment variable on Render.
    *   Initial backend URL obtained: `https://ratm-app.onrender.com`.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** CORS issues addressed (allowing Vercel frontend origin) and backend data loading fixed for production environment.

### Phase 2: Deploying the React Frontend to Vercel
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**
*   **Description:** The React frontend has been successfully updated to connect to the live backend and deployed to Vercel.
*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Frontend `API_BASE_URL` updated to point to the Render backend.
    *   Frontend deployed to Vercel, with the `oauth-dev` branch configured as the production branch for automatic deployments.
    *   Communication between frontend and backend verified (after CORS and data loading fixes).

### Phase 3: Ensuring 100% Uptime with a Paid Plan
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (Assumed to be completed by user as per plan, though not explicitly confirmed via a task.)
*   **Description:** The Render backend service has been upgraded to an always-on plan to ensure continuous availability for future integrations like Yahoo OAuth.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 4: Implementing Yahoo API Integration
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**
*   **Description:** This phase involved integrating the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API for user authentication and data access.
*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   **Backend OAuth Flow Implemented:** Flask backend successfully handles Yahoo OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant flow.
        *   `requests-oauthlib` added to `requirements.txt`.
        *   Yahoo Client ID and Secret configured in `backend/.env`.
        *   `/api/yahoo/login` and `/api/yahoo/callback` endpoints implemented in `app.py`.
        *   `werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix` applied to `app.py` to handle HTTPS when behind `ngrok`.
        *   Backend successfully exchanges authorization code for access tokens with Yahoo.
    *   **Frontend Integration:**
        *   `YahooLeagues.js` component created to display leagues.
        *   `Sidebar.js` updated with "Sign in with Yahoo" button.
        *   Frontend `API_BASE_URL` in `AppContext.js` configured for dynamic switching between local (http://localhost:5000) and production (Render) environments.
        *   Frontend successfully receives the OAuth token in the URL hash after Yahoo redirect and stores it in `localStorage`.
        *   Frontend now sends the `access_token` string in the `Authorization` header to the backend's `/api/yahoo/leagues` endpoint.
        *   Backend successfully receives and processes the `access_token` from the frontend.
        *   Robust frontend parsing logic implemented in `frontend/src/components/YahooLeagues.js` to correctly handle nested Yahoo API response structures.
        *   Resolved race conditions and authentication issues in the frontend token processing.
        *   Cleaned up all temporary debugging statements from both frontend and backend.

## Future Phases (Planned)

### Phase 5: Local Development with ngrok
*   **Description:** Setting up `ngrok` is crucial for local testing of the full Yahoo OAuth flow due to Yahoo's HTTPS callback requirements. This involves tunneling local ports and ensuring the `ngrok` URL is correctly registered with Yahoo. This phase has been actively utilized during the debugging of Phase 4.
    *   `memory-bank/local_development.md` has been created to document these steps.
