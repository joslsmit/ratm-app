## Future Phases (Planned)

This roadmap outlines the development and implementation of new features that leverage the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API.

### Phase 5: Personalized Roster Analysis
*   **Status:** **Not Started**
*   **Concept:** Display a user's Yahoo Fantasy Football roster with integrated AI analysis for each player.
*   **UX Vision:** A new "My Team" tab will appear in the sidebar after a user logs in with Yahoo. This view will feature a dropdown to select a league and will display a card for each player on their roster.

### Phase 6: AI-Powered Waiver Wire Assistant (Yahoo Integrated)
*   **Status:** **Not Started**
*   **Concept:** Provide personalized waiver wire recommendations based on a user's league and roster.
*   **UX Vision:** The existing "Waiver Wire Assistant" will be enhanced. When a user is logged in with Yahoo, it will show a league selector. The UI will present a list of top free agents and allow the user to select a player from their own roster to drop, triggering a personalized AI analysis.

### Phase 7: League-Aware Trade Analyzer
*   **Status:** **Not Started**
*   **Concept:** Analyze trades within the context of the specific league and the rosters of the teams involved.
*   **UX Vision:** The "Trade Analyzer" will be updated to include dropdowns to select the league and the two teams involved in the trade. The player selection inputs will then be populated with the actual rosters of those teams.

### Phase 8: "Draft Grade" Generator
*   **Status:** **Not Started**
*   **Concept:** Provide a comprehensive AI-powered analysis and letter grade of a user's completed draft.
*   **UX Vision:** A new "Draft Grade" tool will be added. After logging in with Yahoo and selecting a league, the user will get a detailed report card for their draft.

### Phase 9: Personalized "Market Inefficiency" Finder
*   **Status:** **Not Started**
*   **Concept:** Highlight players who are undervalued in a user's specific Yahoo league compared to the app's ECR and AI analysis.
*   **UX Vision:** The "Market Inefficiency Finder" will be enhanced with a league selector for logged-in users, showing a tailored list of potential draft-day bargains.

## Development & Testing
*   **Local Development with ngrok:** Setting up `ngrok` is crucial for local testing of the full Yahoo OAuth flow due to Yahoo's HTTPS callback requirements. `memory-bank/local_development.md` has been created to document these steps.
