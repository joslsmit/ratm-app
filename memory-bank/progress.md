# RATM Draft Kit: Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of the RATM Draft Kit project against the defined deployment and integration plan.

## Overall Deployment Goal
Make the RATM Draft Kit app live for friends, affordably and reliably, ensuring it's always online to handle Yahoo API connections and preparing for future development.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Deploying the Flask Backend to Render
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**
*   **Description:** The Python Flask backend has been successfully prepared for production and deployed to Render.
*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   `requirements.txt` generated with all Python dependencies (including `gunicorn`).
    *   Backend deployed to Render with appropriate build and start commands.
    *   `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` configured as an environment variable on Render.
    *   Initial backend URL obtained: `https://ratm-app.onrender.com`.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** CORS issues addressed (allowing Vercel frontend origin) and backend data loading fixed for production environment.

### Phase 2: Deploying the React Frontend to Vercel
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**
*   **Description:** The React frontend has been successfully updated to connect to the live backend and deployed to Vercel.
*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Frontend `API_BASE_URL` updated to point to the Render backend.
    *   Frontend deployed to Vercel, with the `oauth-dev` branch configured as the production branch for automatic deployments.
    *   Communication between frontend and backend verified (after CORS and data loading fixes).

### Phase 3: Ensuring 100% Uptime with a Paid Plan
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (Assumed to be completed by user as per plan, though not explicitly confirmed via a task.)
*   **Description:** The Render backend service has been upgraded to an always-on plan to ensure continuous availability for future integrations like Yahoo OAuth.

## Current Phase

### Phase 4: Implementing Yahoo API Integration
*   **Status:** **IN PROGRESS**
*   **Description:** This phase involves integrating the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API for user authentication and data access.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   **Step 1: Register App with Yahoo:** Register the application with Yahoo Developer Network, obtain Client ID and Secret, and configure the Callback URL. These credentials need to be saved as environment variables on Render.
    *   **Step 2: Add OAuth Flow to Backend:** Implement `/yahoo/login` and `/yahoo/callback` endpoints in the Flask backend to handle the OAuth2 flow (redirection, token exchange, token storage in session).
    *   **Step 3: Add "Sign in with Yahoo" Button to Frontend:** Integrate the official Yahoo sign-in button into the React frontend, linking it to the backend's `/yahoo/login` endpoint.
    *   **Step 4: Handle User Session on Frontend:** Update the frontend to manage the user's Yahoo session status, dynamically showing/hiding login/logout buttons and displaying relevant user data.

## Future Phases (Planned)

### Phase 5 (Optional): Local Development with ngrok
*   **Description:** Setting up ngrok for local testing of the full Yahoo OAuth flow without constant redeployments. This involves tunneling local ports and temporarily updating Yahoo app settings.
