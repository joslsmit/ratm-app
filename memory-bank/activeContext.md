# RATM Draft Kit: Active Context

## 1. Current Focus
The immediate focus is on ensuring the deployed frontend and backend are fully functional and communicating correctly, and on establishing a comprehensive memory bank for the project.

## 2. Ongoing Tasks
*   **Backend Stability:** Monitoring the Render backend for any new errors or performance issues, especially related to data loading and API endpoint responsiveness.
*   **Frontend Functionality:** Verifying all features on the Vercel-deployed frontend (player dossier, rookie rankings, etc.) are working as expected after recent CORS and data loading fixes.
*   **Memory Bank Population:** Continuing to build out the project's memory bank with relevant documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`).

## 3. Immediate Goals
*   Confirm that all backend features are accessible and functional from the Vercel frontend.
*   Ensure the data loading process on Render is stable and reliable.
*   Complete the initial setup of the memory bank with essential context files.

## 4. Open Questions / Pending Decisions
*   Are there any specific features or functionalities that are still exhibiting issues on the deployed versions?
*   Are there any critical data files that are not being loaded or updated correctly on the backend?
*   Should any specific environment variables or configurations be reviewed for optimization or security?

## 5. Recent Interactions & Learnings
*   Successfully addressed CORS issues by updating `backend/app.py` to include the Vercel frontend origin.
*   Resolved backend data loading errors by moving initialization logic out of the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in `backend/app.py`, ensuring data is available on Render.
*   Clarified the purpose and tracking status of the `.clinerules` file (it is now tracked and committed).
*   Established `memory-bank/` as the dedicated directory for project documentation and context files.

## 6. Next Steps
*   **Yahoo API Integration (Local Development):** Successfully migrated from `ngrok` to `mkcert` for local HTTPS development. The `INVALID_REDIRECT_URI` error was resolved by creating a new Yahoo application and ensuring precise matching of `https://localhost:5000/api/yahoo/callback` in both `backend/app.py` and the new Yahoo app settings. Autocomplete functionality is now working.
*   **Continue Phase 4: Yahoo API Integration (Core Functionality).** This involves:
    1.  Implementing the fetching and display of user's Yahoo leagues.
    2.  Handling token storage and refresh more robustly.
    3.  Proceeding with the planned future phases (Personalized Roster Analysis, AI-Powered Waiver Wire Assistant, etc.) which leverage the Yahoo API.
*   Continue to monitor the deployed application for stability.
*   Await further instructions to begin the implementation of core Yahoo API functionality.
