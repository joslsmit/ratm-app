  "confidence": "High",
  "analysis": "### Depth Chart Role\n\nDe'Von Achane enters 2025 as the clear RB1 in the Miami Dolphins' backfield. While Miami may add a complementary piece or utilize Jeff Wilson Jr. and Salvon Ahmed in certain situations, Achane's explosiveness and pass-catching ability make him the focal point of their rushing attack. Expect him to command the majority of early-down carries and be heavily involved in the passing game, particularly in high-leverage situations. His role within this high-powered offense provides a significant advantage.\n\n### Value Analysis\n\nWith a consensus ADP of 16.5 (late first/early second round), Achane presents a strong value proposition. As RB7, he's priced appropriately for his potential. Given his proven ability to produce explosive plays and the Dolphins' commitment to an up-tempo offense, Achane has the upside to significantly outperform his ADP and finish as a top-5 RB. Comparatively, other running backs in this ADP range carry similar or greater risk factors.\n\n### Risk Factors\n\nAchane's primary risk factor is durability. He missed time in 2024 due to injuries, raising concerns about his ability to withstand a full season workload. His size (5'9\", 188 lbs) also makes him potentially more susceptible to injury. Another concern is the presence of other capable backs in Miami. While Achane is the clear lead, Wilson Jr. and Ahmed could siphon touches, particularly if Achane struggles or gets injured. Finally, game script can influence Achane's usage. If Miami frequently plays from behind, they may lean more heavily on the passing game, limiting Achane's opportunities.\n\n### 2025 Outlook\n\nAchane's 2025 outlook is exceptionally bright. He is positioned as the lead back in one of the league's most dynamic offenses, led by Tua Tagovailoa and supported by elite receiving weapons. Expect significant opportunities in both the running and passing game. If he can stay healthy, Achane possesses the potential to be a league-winning running back. A realistic projection would see him accumulating 1,200+ total yards and 10+ touchdowns, making him a valuable asset in PPR formats.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nDe'Von Achane is a high-upside, high-reward pick at his current ADP. While the injury risk is a legitimate concern, his potential to be a top-5 RB in PPR leagues makes him worth the gamble. Drafters should prioritize mitigating this risk by securing a reliable backup running back on their roster, but Achane's game-breaking ability justifies his selection in the late first or early second round."
